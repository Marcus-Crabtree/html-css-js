    <p>
        I joined because I wanted to have a career in programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to take this bootcamp to move into a job/industry that allowed me to use 
        creativity and problem solving skills more directly in my profession. 
        Often times as I worked through various levels of operations/teams, there 
        were adjustments that I would suggest or recommend that 
        required IT to "look into". I always thought it would be something cool to be  
        able to use my experience and to be able to design something myself.
